	 <h3>Histroy</h3>
	 <hr>
	 <p>The fort is believed to have been built by Timmanna Nayaka, a ruler of Vijayanagar Empire in 1454 CE. The fort was in the hands of the Empire till 1495 when the Wodeyars overpowered the Vijayanagar rulers. The fort was subsequently changing hands between Nawab of Arcot, Peshwas and the Marathas.</p>
	 <p>The Wodeyars moved their capital from Mysore to Srirangapatna and established the fort as the seat of the empire. The region and the fort made progressive changes during the rule of Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar during the years 1673 to 1704, but the three subsequent rulers had no impact. During the rule of Krishnaraja Wodeyar (1734â€“66), the kingdom became a strong military force and came under the control of the military general Hyder Ali.</p>
	 <p>Hyder Ali, had to cede the fort to the invading Marathas for 32 lakh rupees during 1757, but he came back strongly to gain it back. During 1782, Tipu Sultan, the son of Hyder Ali took the reign of the fort and built fortifications. Tipu was invaded many times by the British forces.</p>
	 <p>Tipu had agreements with the French and even had letters sent to Napoleon. After several unsuccessful attempts, British forces under the command of Colonel Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, made an attack on 4 May 1799 under the covers. The forces had 2,494 British soldiers and 1,882 Indian troops. The soldiers were asked to wait in trenches and started the advancement across the river during the mid day when the watchmen of the fort used to rest. The account of the offensive is found in the accounts of Colonel Beatson. Tipu was killed in the battle and the English had a treaty with the Wodeyar queen. Lord Mornington commanded the forces and the battle is considered one of the turning point in the colonization strategy of the East Indian Company.</p>
