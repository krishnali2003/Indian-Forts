	 <h3>Histroy</h3>
	 <hr>
	 <p>Originally called Chitrakuta, the Chittor Fort is said to have been built by Chitranga, a king of the maurya (mori) clan .The Guhila (Gahlot) ruler Bappa Rawal is said to have captured the fort in either 728 CE or 734 CE. However, some historians doubt the historicity of this legend, arguing that the Guhilas did not control Chittor before the reign of the later ruler Allata.
	 </p>
 	 <p>In 1303, the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khilji defeated the Guhila king Ratnasimha, and captured the fort. The fort was later captured by Hammir Singh, a king of the Sisodia branch of the Guhilas. Chittor gained prominence during the period of his successors, which included Rana Kumbha and Rana Sanga. In 1535, Bahadur Shah of Gujarat besieged and conquered the fort. After he was driven away by the Mughal emperor Humayun, the fort was given back to Sisodias by him.In 1567–68, the Mughal emperor Akbar besieged and captured the fort and it was under Mughal control until the British Indian Empire.</p>
